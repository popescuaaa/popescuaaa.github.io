Hi, this is Andrei. Iâ€™m documenting my learning notes in this blog and try to showcase some projects. I have a strong background in Machine Learning and Iâ€™m passionate about Data Science, AI, and Software Engineering in general. Iâ€™m also interested in the intersection of these fields with other areas such as <b> Finance </b>, <b> Economics </b>, and <b> Agriculture </b>.

You can check my About page for more details about my background and my projects. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-gabriel-popescu/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and my email address is down below :)

<b>If you have a [project]() in mind, feel free to reach out and we can discuss the details. </b>
