## Research interest ⚗️

In this moment I am focused on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, a branch of Transfer Learning focused on Domain Shifts (i.e train on a source domain $D_{S}$ and test on a target domain $D_{T}$).

Also, I have switched my interest to the Speech Domain and I will be working on End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Systems, ideally right now, based on Open Source models.

## AI Related projects 🛫

- TimeGAN adaptation: 
> Thesis project. The whole work was based on 2019 paper TimeGAN in which the author stated that we can leverage the adavantages of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) into the time series domain and we can generate realistic looking samples starting from noise. Why is this an adapation ? The original work presented only the version in which both the generator ($G$) and the discriminator ($D$) have an underlying structure based on LSTMs and I tested the Tranformer version for this.

## Web development projects 🎈

This projects are graviting around the idea of data visualisation and user experience. I like to experiment as much as I can with new technologies such as: T3 Stack, Tailwind.css + React and different variations of Backend: Python, TypeScript and hopefully, in future something more "compiled" 😋.
