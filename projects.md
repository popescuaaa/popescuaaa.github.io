## Research interest ⚗️

In this moment I am focused on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, a branch of Transfer Learning focused on Domain Shifts (i.e train on a source domain $D_{S}$ and test on a target domain $D_{T}$). More specifically, I am working on Automatic Speech Recognition systems in the UDA context and I try to model modern network systems and their abilities.

👀 Mentoring for Bechelor Thesis projects and Disertation projects as company representative
 - Network topology generation using Genetic Algorithms (Bechelor Thesis)
